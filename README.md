# MNIST

•Trained a 3 layer Dense Neural Network for the classification of handwritten digits data from
0-9 using Machine Learning libraries like Tensorflow and Keras
• Employed the Gradient Descent algorithm to optimize existing parameters and weights
• Obtained an accuracy of 97.7% on the test dataset after training the model in 30 iterations
